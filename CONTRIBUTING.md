## We Develop with Github

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the [KDoc](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kotlin-doc.html).
4. Ensure all tests pass.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue a pull request.
7. You may merge your pull request once you have the sign-off from one other developer.

  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
